  gate
    current consumption:
      mcu - supposedly 1.1mA @ 1MHz
      wifi module - 80mA
      radio module - 12.5mA
      outputs - 200mA
      total - 300-ish mA
    power supply
      lower bound for 3V battery?
      why do boost converters have such high current rating when compared to boost converters?
    4x output stage
    4x input stage
    radio transceiver
    wifi module
  fob
    power supply
    current consumption
      mcu - supposedly 1.1mA @ 1MHz

current ratings for relay diodes and transistors

connector for mcu programming?
  6 pin whatever
vcc, gnd, rst, SPI pins
  but that's 7!
is rst used as a chip select pin for SPI?


better radio?
  the fob doesn't need to receive
  the gate doesn't need to transmit, right?



what's the right way to do power supply / ground when they are isolated for 2 subcircuits?


what clock frequency should we use?


how does the wifi module work in general?
